      <p class="lorao">$42</p>
      <p class="lorab">This ticket is the answer to everything. It grants you access to the vendor hall, all talks and presentations, and lets you grow some courage and submit a lightning talk! Plus, this gets you a fully functional t-shirt, another tote bag that you
        probably don't need which happens to be full of some cool conference swag, and it gets you access to breakfast elevensies, lunch, afternoon tea, and the oh-so-happening CPOSC afterparty. All that goodness and it's only $42.</p>

      <p class="lorao">$0</p>
      <p class="lorab">We believe that information and access to it should be open, free and shared. The Open Access ticket program is an embodiment of that notion. Open Access tickets get you the exact conference experience as the "Answer to Everything" ticket, but you
        get it all for absolutely no cost. These tickes operate like a "take-a-number" line at the deli counter. Any attendee is welcomed to request an Open Access ticket for any reason, no questoins asked. Upon making your request, if there have been
        Open Access donations by other conference attendees, you will receive receive a ticket at no cost! If there are no funds in the donor pool, then you will have to wait intil a donation is made. If not enough donations come in prior to the conference,
        you will be given an opportunity to purchase at the door.</p>

      <p class="lorab">If you happen to believe that access to information (and especially Open Sourced information!) should be free, then here is your chance to help us enable that to happen at this very conference. For every donation of $42, or more to CPOSC, we'll
        grant access to a person who couldn't otherwise attend. These donations make it possible to offer out Open Access ticket initiative, as well as our free and discounted student ticket programs</p>
